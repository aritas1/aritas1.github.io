{"name":"Lightroom face tagging plugin","tagline":"","body":"## Demo\r\n\r\n## Install the plugin\r\nplease [download (latest version from git)](https://github.com/mll-freiburg/lr-facetags/archive/master.zip) the plugin file into the Adobe Lightroom folder (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.7) so that it can run properly.\r\n\r\n### Lightroom\r\n* start Lightroom, and select File -> Plugin Manager.\r\n* in the lower left corner, click Add, and choose the correct directory (in this case it should be C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.7)\r\n* Once installed correctly, you'll see Lightroom Facetags setup as a new plugin within Plugin Manager.\r\n\r\n### Use preview image\r\nIf you like to use the lightroom preview images in your face recognition, you need to adjust some settings:\r\n\r\n1. You need to be able to extract your previews. In Lightroom, choose Edit -> Preferences.\r\n   Then choose the Preset tab and select Show Lightroom Presets folder.\r\n   For this create a folder in the Lightroom folder called Scripts.\r\n   Then copy the ExtractPreviews.lua (inside our plugin file) script into the Scripts folder.\r\n   Quit and reopen Lightroom. Then in Lightroom, choose the ExtractPreviews from the Script menu.\r\n   Finally choose a location for your extracted previews(more information about that in step 2) \r\n   \r\n2. You need to create a folder in C:\\ called Lightroom and another folder inside it called Previews.\r\n   In this folder you should extract all preview photos you want to use for recognition (that would be C:\\Lightroom\\Previews)\r\n\r\n3. Change the lines 27-29 in lrfacetags.lrdevplugin/FacetagsPlugin.lua to:\r\n\r\n`--LrTasks.execute('lrfacetags.lrdevplugin\\\\facetagsPlugin.exe \"%HOMEPATH%\\\\Documents\\\\photosPath.log\"')`<br>\r\n`-- Use preview images stored in C:\\Lightroom\\Previews`<br>\r\n`LrTasks.execute('lrfacetags.lrdevplugin\\\\facetagsPlugin.exe')`<br>\r\n\r\n4. Now the system will use ONLY the images in the folder C:\\Lightroom\\Previews for the face detetion/recognition task.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Workflow\r\n1. Open Lightroom, go to File -> Plugin Extras and click on Lr Facetags.\r\n2. Wait until detection is done. (May take some time, a progressbar will show up)\r\n3. Remove boxes that do not mark faces or you do not need (e.g. if you do not know the person), or add boxes whenever a face was not detected.\r\n4. Add some persons to the training set (see next paragraph).\r\n5. Run face recognition. (May take some time)\r\n6. View results. Change names of persons that were not recognized correctly.\r\n\r\n### Adding images to the training set\r\nThere are three possibilities to add a face to the training set:\r\n\r\n1. Put a box around a face, click on the name of that person and click \"add face\".<br>\r\n2. Click on an existing red box. Click on the name of the person and click \"change face\".<br>\r\n3. If a person was not recognized correctly: Click on the (green) box. Change the name of the person and click \"change face\".\r\n\r\n### Red and green boxes\r\n**Red** boxes mark faces that do not have a name assigned yet.<br>\r\n**Green** boxes mark faces that already have a name assigned. After running face recognition all the boxes will be green.\r\n\r\n### Shortcut keys\r\n- Previous/next image: Arrow left/right\r\n- Remove face: Delete\r\n- Add/change face: Insert\r\n- Clear selection: Escape\r\n\r\n## Source code\r\nThe source code of the external C++ plugin program (witch dose all the magic) can be found in the **source** subfolder.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problems (Bugs)\r\nIf you find a Bug and want to report them, plese use thte Github issues system:\r\nhttps://github.com/mll-freiburg/lr-facetags/issues","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
